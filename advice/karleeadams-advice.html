		<h1>Hi, My name is Karlee.</h1>
		<h2>Here is my list of advice for all coding newbies.</h2>

			<p>"AHH! Learning to code is so overwhelming! I don't even know what I am doing or if it is worth even trying." I have been in your shoes. I know what you are feeling! So I have compiled just a few of the things I think are important for all coding newbies to know. Without further ramblings here is the list:</p>

			<h4>You can do it!</h4>
			<p>First and foremost you need to think you can do it. When you are first learning something it can become overwhelming and discouraging. Don't let that stop you. It takes time, patience, and practice to train yourself to know what you are looking at and what it can do.</p>

			<h4>Google it!</h4>
			<p>Don't worry about knowing everything by memory or right off the bat. It is part of programming to search for help and answers. Knowing how to search is just as important. It's important to problem solve for yourself. Learning this is most of the battle.</p>

			<h4>Ask for help and help others!</h4>
			<p>Contrary to stereotypes, programing is actually very social. People help each other all the time to become better. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Everyone has different things they are really good at so you can help each other grow. Technology is always changing</p>

			<h4>Have fun!</h4>
			<p>Lastly, but most important, have fun! Coding is really fun and has endless possiblities. It doesn't have to be boring or feel like you are hitting your head against a wall. Find ways to make it more exciting and when you get stuck, walk away and come back and try again. Eating something always helps.:)</p>
